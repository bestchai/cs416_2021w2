<h3>Course description</h3>
</p>

<div class="hbar"></div>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie
Lamport</a>, a computer scientist who won the 2013 ACM Turing Award,
gave the following definition of a distributed system:</p>

  <p class="quote"><q><i>A distributed system is one in which the
  failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your
  own computer unusable.</i></q></p>

<p>
Yet, distribution provides numerous benefits. A system becomes more
<b>fault tolerant</b> if there are fewer points of failure and it has
no centralized components. By extending the system with more physical
nodes the system gains performance and becomes more <b>scalable</b>,
capable of handling more load. Distribution can also improve latency,
by improving <b>geographic diversity</b>, by placing resources closer
to clients who use the system.</p>

<p>Achieving these benefits is not easy. As the quote above
illustrates, distributed systems can fail in complex ways and these
systems are more difficult to build, test, and understand than
centralized systems.</p>

<p>
This course will introduce you to a broad range of topics in
distributed systems. The tentative topics are listed in the schedule
below. For the most part this will be a lecture-style course. However,
distributed system concepts are notoriously challenging to internalize
without first-hand experience. The emphasis of this course, therefore,
will be on <b>building</b> distributed system prototypes, small and
large.
</p>

<p>
Course pre-requisites: CPSC 317 (networks) and CPSC 313 (computer
hardware and operating systems).<br/><br/>  Course staff: Ivan
Beschastnikh (Instructor), Yanze (TA), Mishaal (TA), Mayank (TA).
</p>

<h4>Textbooks</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
There are three <i>optional</i> books for this course: 
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0134190440?tracking_id=disfordig-20">Go Programming Language</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Go-Creating-Applications-Developers/dp/0321774639">Programming in Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Distributed-Systems-Principles-Paradigms-2nd/dp/0132392275">Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms (2nd Edition)</a></li>
</ol>

Although there are many tutorials introducing Go and the online Go
documentation is well developed, some of you may find the first two
books on the list helpful for a step-by-step introduction to Go.
</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
  At least part of this course (in January) will be held online,
  therefore it is essential to have clear channels of communication.

  <ul>
    <li>Use
      the <a href="https://www.piazza.com/ubc.ca/winterterm22021/cpsc416">course
        Piazza</a> for <b>all</b> course-related communication. The Piazza
      also supports private posts that you can use to communicate with the
      instructor and the TAs.</li>
    
    <li>We will use Zoom for synchronous online sessions (in January)
      during the scheduled course hours. These sessions will be
      recorded and made available to you. You can find the zoom links
      and zoom recordings on
      the <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/83427">course Canvas</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h4>Course-level learning goals</h4>
<div class="hbarshort"></div>

<p>
The course will provide an opportunity for students to
<ul>
  <li>understand key principles in designing and implementing distributed systems</li>
  <li>reason about problems that involve distributed components</li>
  <li>become familiar with important techniques for solving problems that arise in distributed contexts</li>
  <li>build distributed system prototypes using the Go programming language</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Go resources</h3>
</p>

<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
In this course we will exclusively use
the <a href="http://golang.org/">Go programming language</a> for all
course work. Learning a new programming language is an important
skill. You will practice it in this course. For the most part I will
expect that you learn this language on your own. <b>We will be using
Go version 1.16.7</b> (available at <code>/cs/local/bin/go</code> on
ugrad servers). If you use a personal machine, make sure to install
this exact version. Though, please note that all homework solutions
will be tested on the ugrad server machines.
</p>

<p>
Go is a systems language originally introduced by Google. It is
especially well suited to building distributed systems. Like with any
language, the fastest way to become proficient at Go is to put in the
time writing programs in Go. Here are some resources to get you
started:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">Go tutorial (start here)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">How to Write Go Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">Effective Go</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book">Go Bootcamp (online book)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gobyexample.com/">Go by Example</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Learn">More Go resources</a></li>
</ul>

Amanda and Stewart led an in-class Go tutorial in the Winter 2017
version of the course. Here is the recorded
version: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L04p8SSmW-c&t=1s">part
1</a>,
and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAU1_chlGBA&t=1786s">part
2</a>. 

</p>

<p>
After you install the correct version of Go, you can now install an
IDE of your choice. One option is <b>JetBrain's GoLand</b>, which
provides free licenses for their software to anyone currently enrolled
in school. You have to
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">register here</a> with
your UBC email, and you will be given a license for their
software. You can renew this license each year that you are a
student. You can then download GoLand and activate it by using the
license. When you are about to create a new project, you will need to
select the correct SDK version for your project, which you can do by
selecting the path of your go installation. Several advantages of GoLand:
<ul>
<li>smart completion</li>
<li>hover over a function and see it's documentation</li>
<li>built-in debugger with a nice UI</li>
<li>quick navigation between files and symbols</li>
<li>easy refactoring</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to do well in this course</h3>
</p>

<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
<b>Learn Go early and practice it regularly.</b> Learning a new
language while being time constrained is stressful and not fun. Since
the assignments rapidly increase in their difficulty, it will be to
your advantage to learn Go as quickly as possible and to learn it
well. The posted <a href="#go">Go resources</a> are a great starting
point, but reading is no substitute for practice, bug, debug,
practice, practice, bug, coffee, debug, practice, ...
</p>

<p>
<b>Do not skimp on software engineering.</b> Distributed systems are
hard. They are hard to understand, to build, to debug, to run, to
trace, to document, etc. Do not make your life any more difficult. Use
best practices from software engineering to help you in this
course. Write unit and integration tests, use version control,
document your code with comments, write small prototypes, refactor
your code, make your code readable and easy to run and debug. If you
fail to follow best practices, they will come back to bite you later
on. Unfortunately, this course will not explicitly teach you these
best practices, but you probably took a course that introduced you to
these concepts. If you have any questions, just ask us on Piazza.
</p>

<!-- <p>
<b>Choose your teammates, wisely.</b> Some assignments will depend
critically on your ability to work effectively with one other
student. You are responsible for resolving personal and technical
differences among teammates on your own. Let us know as early as
possible if you have team concerns, before they turn into crises.
</p> -->

<p>
<b>Reach out for success.</b> This is intended to be a challenging
fourth year course, but that does not mean that you have to work
through it on your own!  The course piazza should be your first stop
for all technical questions. The course has specific office hours (see
top of page), but I and the TAs are flexible. Send any of us an email
to schedule a time to discuss the course, the assignments,
etc. University students often encounter setbacks from time to time
that can impact academic performance. Discuss your situation with us
or an academic advisor as early as possible. For help in addressing
mental or physical health concerns, including seeing a UBC counselor
or doctor, visit

<h3>Academic integrity, collaboration guidelines, resources</h3>
</p>

<div class="hbar"></div>

<p>
UBC has a detailed policy
regarding
<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/resources/academic-integrity">academic
integrity</a>. You must familiarize yourself with this policy.
</p>

<p>
  UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain
  healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so
  there are additional resources to access including those for
  survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and
  ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and
  discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic
  freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with
  disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values
  academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas
  generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in
  all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access
  support are
  available <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success">here</a>.
